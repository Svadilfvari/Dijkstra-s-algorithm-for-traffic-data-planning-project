The aim of this project is to create an application that determines the shortest route between two stations on the Paris metro network.

In graph theory, a directed graph is a set of points (here, entrances to metro stations) connected by directed links (here, connections between stations, in seconds). In the context of this project, each link represents a possibility to connect two points, in a specific direction, and at a specific cost. It's a possible connection between these points. The shortest path problem, in this system, is to evaluate the minimum cost of going from point A to point B. Dijkstra's algorithm is a computational method for solving this problem.
